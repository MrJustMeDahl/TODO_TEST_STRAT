# Instructions and answers:

## 1. Develop a simple to-do list application where users can:
### - Add, update, delete and mark tasks as completed.
### - Categorize tasks into different lists.
### - Set deadlines for tasks.
### - Key components for testing.

## 2. Test Strategy Design:
### - Create a test strategy that includes unit tests, integration tests and specification-based tests.
### - Discuss how each type of test contributes to the overall quality of the software.

## 3. Implementation:
### - Implement the test strategy using one of the frameworks (NUnit, XUnit, MSTest) or equivalent in your chosen language.
### - Write a minimum of 5 unit tests, 3 integration tests and 1 specification-based tests.

## 4. Use of Test Doubles:
### - Incorporate test doubles where necessary, based on the principles discussed by Martin Fowler.
### - Clearly explain why and how you used each type of test double.

## 5. Validation through Mutation Testing:
### - Apply mutation testing to validate the effectiveness of your test suite.
### - Provide a detailed analysis of the mutation testing results and how they informed you testing process.

## 6. Verification vs. Validation:
### - Reflect on the destinction between verification and validation as outlined in the Plutora article.
### - Ensure your tests address both aspects, and document how each is covered.

## 7. Software Quality Reflection:
### - Read the article by Peter Morlion and evaluate your test strategy in the context of software quality.
### - Reflect on how your testing approach could be improved to better ensure quality.

## 8. Discussion on Test Categories:
### - Briefly discuss the test categories as outlined by Martin Fowler and classify the tests you have implemented accordingly.
